## My goal
Trying to solve each puzzle each day. I hope I'll have enough time and motivation to do so.

## My own rules

The puzzles will be solved in Swift.

No cheating. Many other person do the puzzle. I'll have to come up with my own solution ... or skipping a day.

Some code may be reused from one day to another.

Not all special cases will be treated by the code.

Some attention will be ported to performance consideration, let try to make that less than 5 seconds per day!

## Puzzle solutions so far

| Day    | Computing time* | Part 1   | Part 2     |

| **2**  | 0,006s          | 4576384  | 5398       |
| **3**  | 0,45s           | 709      | 13836      |
